# App
Frontend of our mobile application

Setup and run:
run npm i to install dependencies 

You should be able to run with npx expo start. This should generate a QR code for you
to scan with your device. 

Make sure you have Expo Go installed on the device you choose to use if you are doing the QR
code route.

Scanning the QR code will open the application in Expo Go on the device. You are able to 
run and test things there.
